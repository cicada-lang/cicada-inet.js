# connected component

`allActiveEdges` -- `Net` should not have `activeEdges`

`Connection` should not have `edge`

[builtin] `inspect` -- if the element is a port, print its connected component

[builtin] `run` -- only run the top port -- connected component

- need to `createEnv` for the net component

coherent space -- understand the denotational semantics of linear logic

understand proof-nets for all connectives

# example

use inet to encode lambda calculus

# module

support `private` statement prefix to define private aux nodes

support `import as` -- `Mod` as `Value`
