`occurCheck` -- reject infinite term

# later

`claim` use `SignedType` as `input` and `output`

# example

Nat -- `mul` -- with `nat_dup` and `nat_erase`

Nat -- `max` -- with `max_aux`

# module

# value

the stack can take other types of values -- not only port

`'a` should be a value

`key: value` should be a value (Pair)

- support JSON syntax

use `()` for prefix application -- one `,` one substack

# example

use inet to encode lambda calculus
