[checkWords] I expect the stack to be empty after checking.

  stack length: 1
  stack: [(_cap_output_node_from_typeâ‚€)-covering!]

  Maybe this is due to extra input arity,
  or lack of output arity.

[Define.execute] I fail to define word.

  word: swapswap

 1 |claim swapswap 'A 'A -- 'A end
 2 |define swapswap swap swap end
 3 |
