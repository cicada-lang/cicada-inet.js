[checkSigns] I expect the two ports to have opposite signs,
  but they all have positive sign.

  first port: (sole)-value!
  second port: (sole)-value!

[compose] I fail compose word.

  word: connect

 1 |type Trivial -- Type end
 2 |node sole -- Trivial :value! end
 3 |
 4 |begin sole sole connect end
 5 |

[Begin.execute] I fail to begin.

 1 |type Trivial -- Type end
 2 |node sole -- Trivial :value! end
 3 |
 4 |begin sole sole connect end
 5 |
