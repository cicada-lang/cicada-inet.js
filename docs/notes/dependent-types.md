title: Dependent Types
---

Simple type system is easy to implement,
how about dependent type system?

If we can implement equality between `Net`s,
we can use `Net` as value,
and use "two levels of composition" -- execute and cut,
to view type declaration in a node
the same as rule declaration
and thus implement dependent types.
