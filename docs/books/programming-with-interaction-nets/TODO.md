## Introduction

Interaction nets is an interesting computation model designed by Yves Lafont in 1990,
It uses undirected graphs and graph rewriting to express computations.

It is interesting because:

> Our interaction nets are deterministic in a strong sense:
> not only the result, but also the computation is unique,
> up to trivial commutations.
