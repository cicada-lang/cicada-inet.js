# 1

At the end of 2021,
I occasionally read a 1990 paper "Interaction Nets",
by Yves Lafont.
The paper introduced a very interesting new computation model,
using graph of nodes and edges as data,
and viewing interaction between connected nodes as computation.

In this paper, I will follow Lafont's examples
to introduce the principal of interaction nets.
And I will also introduce the language I designed
to practice this computation model.

My language's main contribution to interaction nets,
is to use stack and postfix notation to build nets.

What is stack? What is postfix notation? How to build nets?

Read this paper to see detailed explanation :)
